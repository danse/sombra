how to emulate the non visual channels? producing sounds?

any note at a given tempo
visual feedback when on or off tempo

don't burn channels
viewing slows them down

a plane with small circles moving, a big circle moves slower

sending a signal should be different from moving, intentional

a visible parameter (size)
another invisible parameter (vibes)
configurable focus size
high cost on burning

size zero turns color white (incandeshent)
high vibe

both change speeds can be hidden

samsara is destroying
correct gaming creates structures

indirected graph

stars in a blue sky

another hidden par is velocity change

still stars create constellations

audio could be a kind of safe channel

vibe could naturally decay

the player could have their path in the space
