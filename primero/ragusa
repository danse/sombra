un sistema formale é come un gioco il cui obiettivo non é di
divertire. l'intento può essere una utile dimensione di analisi dei
giochi come forma d'arte.

per dimensione intendo uno spazio emotivo, conoscitivo e esplorativo
come quello creato dal ripetersi di una parola.

_interfaces_ are built on _programming_ interfaces which are built on data _models_, which are built on data _structures_, so an application is a specification at multiple levels, so one could assume that the most general levels have more impact. sometimes the decisions made at the highest level are not discussed. at the data model level though it's very common

expression | representation

is a non-terminating program also representation?

in a formalism or system a predicate is represented if:
 all true instances are theorems and
 all false instances are nontheorems

a theorem is a decidable string

if all possible predicates are represented in an axiomatic system, the
system is complete

systems can be complete with reference to primitive recursive
predicates

studying is like building a delicate structure that distractions shake

at the same time, studying well generates distractions

this is why a study based on a theme could be superior to one based on continuity or result

shaky constructions can be made more robust without adding too much rigidity, for example by talking

my room has a personality and talks with the voice of its music. i leave it.

and this is my desk, this is my dashboard
standing, multimodal, shirtless, with music
with a window open on an orchard with singing birds
undisciplined, rule-less, comfortable
social, emotional, fresh, barefoot
nomadic, mental, unclassified
unique, ambitious, humble
free, cheap, open
weird, unconventional, lonely
physical, sustainable ...
but still insecure
unstable, maybe it's a feature.
technological, connected, hacked
traditional ignorant, curious, studying

the music is not loud, it leaves time and volume for thought and
conversation, for the enthusiasm to grow with the volume

and if i want to stretch and dance, i can
