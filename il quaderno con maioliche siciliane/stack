writing is public speaking
for introverts

summoned (conjured) space

summoned ilaria

sometimes a lot
that wait for a while
on this stack
i am identities
that i am losing
that i am letting go
that i'm not doing
with all these things in the stack
the life of a loser is so weird

who thinks they can free code
without freeing documentation
communication, strategy
processes, culture?

because it depends upon the arrival of other elements
while in a stack it's impossible
it's possible for an element to have an expectation at every given moment
in a queue with constant processing

free to screw up my life

at that point i started broadening the extent of my work with colleagues
specialisation may or may not happen
as a developer i can do it equally well alone or with people
i thought that development was like taking care of a garden
some lead somewhere some don't
one does different attempts
that's slow
like a flow
i thought that energy could be seen like a plant
and that cannot be controlled
because it was guided by pleasure
not as progress towards completion of a given task
so productivity came as innovation
and i ended up being spreaded shallow
always opening new fronts
i felt productive towards different directions
in august i had a problem with the kind of productivity

take that nap, sleep deprivation!

a resisting body acts like a filter
 tension low-frequency (due to higher energies)
 clean high-frequency
frequency shake, vibe

discourse moves through meanings

at this point i was having troubles managing extreme development
working on sorting of items by recency and offgrid first

to move and explore
moving the blanket of comfort to cover and uncover different areas

comfortable settings for uncomfortable truths
distractios is also a kind of comfort

we develop our identities and they lead us through our destiny
we look at the identities and browse their streams
i follow what i can and what i feel
can get stronger than what i can handle
i'm at the edges of a world whose force

then i worked a bit on productivity and value unrelated to discipline

consistency x change

about work only at night?
i had time to think and worry
why in the past

for our travels through complexity
programming like packing logic

ma non per uno sviluppatore
utile per gli storici e gli archeologi
per un po' ancora utile nell'inerzia
rigido, solido, morto
tracciando il suolo
di un'unghia che si consuma
mi sembran come tessuto osseo
o li evito se preferibile
li prendo in giro come vogliono
non mi sembran minacciosi stasera
i sistemi polverosi ed ingiusti

risks costs our richness
 thinking of expression
 and why many peps
 won't dare to say
 what could make sense

we are all burn out internet writers

chaos programming

i know their limits
i find them powerful
i care about words

the paranoid programmer

you don't want to get mad
it's terrible
you don't understand anything
life is unmanageable
and you hate yourself
yeah, some of us have experienced something
that is worse than pain
the feeling to be off life
kind of paralysed
but full of rage
and with no solution
maybe i was feeling wrong
without remedy
broken at the deepest level
i'm not afraid any more
to say that i'm mad, fool or crazy
because now i know i'm not
seein your nightmares come true
or nightmare you didn't knew you had
be useless
but tears are bad as well, right?
not for me
maybe one nadir is also one zenith

every meaning needs to be expressed

when i was not high any longer
cannabis gave me the best experiences

 comfort
 follow
 a desert
 threads
 tune tones
 base
 venice
 obliquity
 il disegno di un bicchiere d'acqua al suolo
 serendipity
 dimensions
 detachment
 dance
 rethread
 duplication
 archive
 wraps
 refactor
 interferencias
 relax
 nadir
 need
a febbraio a ragusa queste sono:
ho cominciato le carte in agosto in madrid

effetto venezia
