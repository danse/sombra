finish soller october   20
start  soller september 1

like a web for flying
  some words get wind
          other don't

i thought i could bring it to ragusa
a dance from soller
i found something

the archive and the draining context
use extracts, it's contextual, diversifying
time archives, it's collective, homogenising
u - system

summon space

 sober
retract then shake
hesitate doubt
in trance
and hang like a puppet with broken strings
vulnerable
and fall again
and drop
and lose
fail laughing
fail loud
fail hard
and fail
in the void
open eyes
open mouth
blank
stare
shake and collapse
collapse and think
again and again
raise
and from the floor
cry and fall
fall and cry
a place where

connette
l'acume trapassa nelle due direzioni

all dance is a pleasure of listening

open your doors and listen

    _
= _ =
= = =
o-o-o
it can work on parallel cursors
no tiene que ser serial
it can be a stacky connecting
synthesize
and simplify
react together
can eliminate duplication
crossing serial archives
networking linking requires fetching from the past
linking, connection, networking
serial flow

will as an artefact

effortlessness
cause i don't let myself to be carried away
i see my resources falling short

by choosing to never reach them
or you let them survive
either you make your dreams mortal

summoned out

and opening up the more i thinked about it
suited with all the context
out of an ambitious vision
it was a fractal direction
i knew what i wanted to produce

wrapping processing stages with `group`
name < unselected name1 name2 < unbalanced < unclipped < original 

summoned chaos

non avrebbe senso
un fiume di blocchi
bloccare

the friends i want will know me
i cannot wayt any longer to be alone for being myself
in order to grow
to be alone
i cannot wait any longer
and i still want to work on it
what i want to be is changing

no need to limit yourself if the context is limiting you

showing mercy of myself
and doing tasks in the middle of the day
after five years
with doubts
and the confidence of nowhere and antonio

let lateral thinking happen

to exist as a contradiction
can reveal
contradictions elsewhere

natural awakening is a treat. it's very slow. first my mind would feel empty. then without energy then sad, then i started having several ideas, memories, reflection. i think it took one hour more or less. now i'm still on the bad but full of energies and feeling creative. i don't jump standing in order not to disturb the others in the home, but i feel inspired despite the gray day. no need for hemp

a volte non importa condividere
ma l'esibizionismo Ã© una venatura di sviluppo
abbassa il costo per condivisione

summoned energy

concept is not created at the same time
but perceived at the same time

summoned sottile
